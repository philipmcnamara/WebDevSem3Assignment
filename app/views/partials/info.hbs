        <li>The Cliffs of Moher has featured in classic movies like The Princess Bride and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.</li>
        <li>The Cliffs of Moher was a ‘tourist attraction’ before that phrase was even heard of. In the early 19th century, the then landowner, Cornelius O’Brien, parliamentarian, and proud Clare man, built O’Brien’s Tower so that the expansive cliff views across the Atlantic Ocean from Liscannor Bay to Galway Bay could be fully appreciated.
            This paved the way for today’s centre to be the top visitor attraction in Ireland and on the Wild Atlantic Way.</li>
        <li>It is now part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher UNESCO Global Geopark supporting sustainable tourism and has been a special protected area for birds and wildlife since 1979, home to 35 different species of birds</li>
